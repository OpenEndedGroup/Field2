/**
 * The below classes implement support for routing aynchronous messages between JavaScript running in the renderer process and C++ running in the
 * browser process. An application interacts with the router by passing it data from standard CEF C++ callbacks (OnBeforeBrowse,
 * OnProcessMessageRecieved, OnContextCreated, etc). The renderer-side router supports generic JavaScript callback registration and execution while
 * the browser-side router supports application-specific logic via one or more application-provided Handler instances.
 * <p>
 * The renderer-side router implementation exposes a query function and a cancel function via the JavaScript 'window' object:
 * <p>
 * // Create and send a new query. var request_id = window.cefQuery({ request: 'my_request', persistent: false, onSuccess: function(response) {},
 * onFailure: function(error_code, error_message) {} });
 * <p>
 * // Optionally cancel the query. window.cefQueryCancel(request_id);
 * <p>
 * When |window.cefQuery| is executed the request is sent asynchronously to one or more C++ Handler objects registered in the browser process. Each
 * C++ Handler can choose to either handle or ignore the query in the Handler::OnQuery callback. If a Handler chooses to handle the query then it
 * should execute Callback::Success when a response is available or Callback::Failure if an error occurs. This will result in asynchronous execution
 * of the associated JavaScript callback in the renderer process. Any queries unhandled by C++ code in the browser process will be automatically
 * canceled and the associated JavaScript onFailure callback will be executed with an error code of -1.
 * <p>
 * Queries can be either persistent or non-persistent. If the query is persistent than the callbacks will remain registered until one of the following
 * conditions are met:
 * <p>
 * A. The query is canceled in JavaScript using the |window.cefQueryCancel| function. B. The query is canceled in C++ code using the Callback::Failure
 * function. C. The context associated with the query is released due to browser destruction, navigation or renderer process termination.
 * <p>
 * If the query is non-persistent then the registration will be removed after the JavaScript callback is executed a single time. If a query is
 * canceled for a reason other than Callback::Failure being executed then the associated Handler's OnQueryCanceled method will be called.
 * <p>
 * Some possible usage patterns include:
 * <p>
 * One-time Request. Use a non-persistent query to send a JavaScript request. The Handler evaluates the request and returns the response. The query is
 * then discarded.
 * <p>
 * Broadcast. Use a persistent query to register as a JavaScript broadcast receiver. The Handler keeps track of all registered Callbacks and executes
 * them sequentially to deliver the broadcast message.
 * <p>
 * Subscription. Use a persistent query to register as a JavaScript subscription receiver. The Handler initiates the subscription feed on the first
 * request and delivers responses to all registered subscribers as they become available. The Handler cancels the subscription feed when there are no
 * longer any registered JavaScript receivers.
 * <p>
 * Message routing occurs on a per-browser and per-context basis. Consequently, additional application logic can be applied by restricting which
 * browser or context instances are passed into the router. If you choose to use this approach do so cautiously. In order for the router to function
 * correctly any browser or context instance passed into a single router callback must then be passed into all router callbacks.
 * <p>
 * There is generally no need to have multiple renderer-side routers unless you wish to have multiple bindings with different JavaScript function
 * names. It can be useful to have multiple browser-side routers with different client- provided Handler instances when implementing different
 * behaviors on a per- browser basis.
 * <p>
 * This implementation places no formatting restrictions on payload content. An application may choose to exchange anything from simple formatted
 * strings to serialized XML or JSON data.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE USAGE
 * <p>
 * 1. Define the router configuration. You can optionally specify settings like the JavaScript function names. The configuration must be the same in
 * both the browser and renderer processes. If using multiple routers in the same application make sure to specify unique function names for each
 * router configuration.
 * <p>
 * // Example config object showing the default values. CefMessageRouterConfig config = new CefMessageRouterConfig(); config.jsQueryFunction =
 * "cefQuery"; config.jsCancelFunction = "cefQueryCancel";
 * <p>
 * 2. Create an instance of CefMessageRouter in the browser process.
 * <p>
 * messageRouter_ = CefMessageRouter.create(config);
 * <p>
 * 3. Register one or more Handlers. The Handler instances must either outlive the router or be removed from the router before they're deleted.
 * <p>
 * messageRouter_.addHandler(myHandler);
 * <p>
 * 4. Add your message router to all CefClient instances you want to get your JavaScript code be handled.
 * <p>
 * myClient.addMessageRouter(messageRouter_);
 * <p>
 * 4. Execute the query function from JavaScript code.
 * <p>
 * window.cefQuery({request: 'my_request', persistent: false, onSuccess: function(response) { print(response); }, onFailure: function(error_code,
 * error_message) {} });
 * <p>
 * 5. Handle the query in your CefMessageRouterHandler.onQuery implementation and execute the appropriate callback either immediately or
 * asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * public boolean onQuery(CefBrowser browser, long query_id, String request, boolean persistent, CefQueryCallback callback) { if
 * (request.indexOf("my_request") == 0) { callback.success("my_response"); return true; } return false;  // Not handled. }
 * <p>
 * 6. Notice that the success callback is executed in JavaScript.
