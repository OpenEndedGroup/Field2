	/**
	 * Register a custom scheme. This method should not be called for the built-in HTTP, HTTPS, FILE, FTP, ABOUT and DATA schemes.
	 * <p>
	 * If |isStandard| is true the scheme will be treated as a standard scheme. Standard schemes are subject to URL canonicalization and parsing
	 * rules as defined in the Common Internet Scheme Syntax RFC 1738 Section 3.1 available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
	 * <p>
	 * In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the form:
	 * <pre>
	 *  [scheme]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[url-path]
	 * </pre>
	 * Standard scheme URLs must have a host component that is a fully qualified domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [13] and
	 * Section 2.1 of RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path" in the simplest case and
	 * "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most explicit case. For example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path" will both
	 * be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path". The origin of a standard scheme URL is the combination of scheme, host and port (i.e.,
	 * "scheme://host:port" in the most explicit case).
	 * <p>
	 * For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed and canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the
	 * handler as-is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the same. Non-standard scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form
	 * submission.
	 * <p>
	 * If |isLocal| is true the scheme will be treated as local (i.e., with the same security rules as those applied to "file" URLs). Normal pages
	 * cannot link to or access local URLs. Also, by default, local URLs can only perform XMLHttpRequest calls to the same URL (origin + path)
	 * that originated the request. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to other URLs with the same origin set the
	 * CefSettings.file_access_from_file_urls_allowed value to true. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to all origins set the
	 * CefSettings.universal_access_from_file_urls_allowed value to true.
	 * <p>
	 * If |isDisplayIsolated| is true the scheme will be treated as display- isolated. This means that pages cannot display these URLs unless they
	 * are from the same scheme. For example, pages in another origin cannot create iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with this scheme.
	 * <p>
	 * This function may be called on any thread. It should only be called once per unique |schemeName| value. If |schemeName| is already
	 * registered or if an error occurs this method will return false.
