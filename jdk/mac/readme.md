This directory should include a JDK capable of running Field on your machine. Specifically we require a JDK with JCEF (the Java Chrominium Embedded Framework) included in it. Fortunately Jetbrains have us covered here (and it is fortunate: maintaining a command-line compatible, genuinely embeddable build of JCEF is basically a full time job).

Download a "JBR with JCEF" with a JDK version 17 here:
